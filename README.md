# rotv

This repository is a django project for [Raport Obieżyświata](http://raportobiezyswiata.tv) website. All apps used here are in a separate lib [django-rotv-apps](https://github.com/ivellios/django-rotv-apps).

## Our story

At first this package was created for [Raport Obieżyświata](http://raportobiezyswiata.tv) - a leading web tv channel in Poland dedicated to sci-fi and fantasy news reporting, book reviews and conventions recaps.

Since the very begining the work of our group, we were working voluntarily to provide the best quality videos for the Polish Fandom. Thus we decided to release our source code of the website to provide others with tools for creating their own great project.

## Language note

This project was created only for Polish region. Thus the verbose names for the fields are in Polish. In the future we plan to provide English as a base language for the package.

## How to use this package

The full documentation for the package is due to be created.
